MagmaPandas
===========

MagmaPandas is a `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ based tool set for geochemical calculations and modelling.
It makes working with geochemical data easier by extending the Pandas DataFrame
with methods for common calculations, including those for:

   * mole and cation conversion,
   * mineral composition by stoichiometry,
   * melt thermometry,
   * melt Fe speciation,
   * oxygen fugacity,
   * melt volatile (CO\ :sub:`2`\-H\ :sub:`2`\O) saturation pressure
   * mineral-melt element partition coefficients,


MagmaPandas can be combined with `MagmaPEC <https://github.com/TDGerve/MagmaPEC>`_ for post-entrapment crystallisation correction of compositions of olivine hosted melt inclusions.
