  abstract     = {The effect of {MgO} and total {FeO} on ferric/ferrous ratio in model multicomponent silicate melts was investigated experimentally in the temperature range 1300–1500 °C at 1 atm total pressure in air. We demonstrate that the addition of these weak network modifier cations results in an increase of Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio in both mafic and silicic melts. Based on present and published experimental data, a new empirical equation is proposed to predict the ferric/ferrous ratio as a function of oxygen fugacity, temperature and melt composition. In contrast to previous equations, the compositional effect of melts on the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio is not only modeled by the sum of the molar fraction of the individual oxide components. Additional interactions terms have also been incorporated. The main advantage of the proposed model is its applicability for a wide compositional range. However, its application to felsic melts ({\textgreater} 68 wt\% {SiO}2) is not recommended. Other advantages of this equation and differences when compared with previous models are discussed.},

@article{holland_enlarged_1990,

  abstract     = {We present, as a progress report, a revised and much enlarged version of the thermodynamic dataset given earlier (Holland \& Powell, 1985). This new set includes data for 123 mineral and fluid end‐members made consistent with over 200 P–T–{XCO}2–{fO}2 phase equilibrium experiments. Several improvements and advances have been made, in addition to the increased coverage of mineral phases: the data are now presented in three groups ranked according to reliability; a large number of iron‐bearing phases has been included through experimental and, in some cases, natural Fe:Mg partitioning data; H2O and {CO}2 contents of cordierites are accounted for with the solution model of Kurepin (1985); simple Landau theory is used to model lambda anomalies in heat capacity and the Al/Si order–disorder behaviour in some silicates, and Tschermak‐substituted end‐members have been derived for iron and magnesium end‐members of chlorite, talc, muscovite, biotite, pyroxene and amphibole. For the subset of data which overlap those of Berman (1988), it is encouraging to find both (1) very substantial agreement between the two sets of thermodynamic data and (2) that the two sets reproduce the phase equilibrium experimental brackets to a very similar degree of accuracy. The main differences in the two datasets involve size (123 as compared to 67 end‐members), the methods used in data reduction (least squares as compared to linear programming), and the provision for estimation of uncertainties with this dataset. For calculations on mineral assemblages in rocks, we aim to maximize the information available from the dataset, by combining the equilibria from all the reactions which can be written between the end‐members in the minerals. For phase diagram calculations, we calculate the compositions of complex solid solutions (together with P and T) involved in invariant, univariant and divariant assemblages. Moreover we strongly believe in attempting to assess the probable uncertainties in calculated equilibria and hence provide a framework for performing simple error propagation in all calculations in thermocalc, the computer program we offer for an effective use of the dataset and the calculation methods we advocate.

@article{holland1998,

  abstract     = {The thermodynamic properties of 154 mineral end-members, 13 silicate liquid end-members and 22 aqueous fluid species are presented in a revised and updated data set. The use of a temperature-dependent thermal expansion and bulk modulus, and the use of high-pressure equations of state for solids and fluids, allows calculation of mineral-fluid equilibria to 100 kbar pressure or higher. A pressure-dependent Landau model for order-disorder permits extension of disordering transitions to high pressures, and, in particular, allows the alpha-beta quartz transition to be handled more satisfactorily. Several melt end-members have been included to enable calculation of simple phase equilibria and as a first stage in developing melt mixing models in {NCKFMASH}. The simple aqueous species density model has been extended to enable speciation calculations and mineral solubility determination involving minerals and aqueous species at high temperatures and pressures. The data set has also been improved by incorporation of many new phase equilibrium constraints, calorimetric studies and new measurements of molar volume, thermal expansion and compressibility. This has led to a significant improvement in the level of agreement with the available experimental phase equilibria, and to greater flexibility in calculation of complex mineral equilibria. It is also shown that there is very good agreement between the data set and the most recent available calorimetric data.},

@article{iacono-marziano_new_2012,

  abstract     = {We present here new experimental data on H 2O-{CO} 2 solubility in mafic melts with variable chemical compositions (alkali basalt, lamproite and kamafugite) that extend the existing database. We show that potassium and calcium-rich melts can dissolve {\textasciitilde}1wt\% {CO} 2 at 3500bar (350MPa) and 1200°C, whereas conventional models predict solubilities of 0.2-0.5wt\%, under similar P-T conditions. These new data, together with those in the literature, stress the fundamental control of melt chemical composition on {CO} 2 solubility. We present a semi-empirical H 2O-{CO} 2 solubility model for mafic melts, which employs simplified concepts of gas-melt thermodynamics coupled with a parameterization of both chemical composition and structure of the silicate melt. The model is calibrated on a selected database consisting of 289 experiments with 44 different mafic compositions. Statistical analyses of the experimental data indicate that, in mafic melts, the chemical composition and therefore the structure of the melt plays a fundamental role in {CO} 2 solubility. {CO} 2 solubility strongly depends on the amount of non-bridging oxygen per oxygen ({NBO}/O) in the melt, but the nature of the cation bonded to {NBO} is also critical. Alkalis (Na+K) bonded to {NBO} result in a strong enhancement of {CO} 2 solubility, whereas Ca has a more moderate effect. Mg and Fe bonded to {NBO} have the weakest effect on {CO} 2 solubility. Finally, we modelled the effect of water and concluded that H 2O dissolution in the melt enhances {CO} 2 solubility most likely by triggering {NBO} formation. In contrast with {CO} 2 but in agreement with earlier findings, H 2O solubility in mafic melts is negligibly affected by melt composition and structure: it only shows a weak correlation with {NBO}/O. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Ultrasonic longitudinal acoustic velocities in oxidized silicate liquids indicate that the pressure derivative of the partial-molar volume of Fe2O3 is the same in iron-rich alkali-, alkaline earth- and natural silicate melt compositions at 1 bar. The d V/d P for multicomponent silicate liquids can be expressed as a linear combination of partial-molar constants plus a positive excess term for Na2O-Al2O3 mixing. Partial-molar properties for {FeO} and Fe2O3 components allow extension of the empirical expression of Sack et al. (1980) to permit the calculation of Fe-redox equilibrium in a natural silicate liquid as a function of composition, temperature, fo2 and pressure; a more formal thermodynamic expression is presented in the Appendix. The predicted equilibrium fo2 of natural silicate melts, of fixed oxygen content, closely parallels that defined by the metastable assemblage fayalite+magnetite+β-quartz ({FMQ}), in pressure-temperature space. A silicate melt initially equilibrated at 3 {GPa} and {FMQ}, will remain within approximately 0.5 log10 units of {FMQ} during its closed-system ascent. Thus, for magmas closed to oxygen, iron-redox equilibrium in crystal-poor pristine glassy lavas represents an excellent probe of the relative oxidation state of their source regions. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract     = {The oxidation state of a basaltic liquid may be obtained from the average valence state of Fe in its quenched glass. Suitable glasses are widely available from the basalts erupted at Mid-Ocean Ridges ({MORB}). Measurements of Fe3+/∑Fe, where ∑Fe=Fe2++Fe3+, by {XANES} spectroscopy of a globally representative sample of these {MORB} glasses are in good agreement with the most recent literature values determined by wet chemistry, but have improved precision, with an expected standard deviation of ±0.01 in Fe3+/∑Fe for each independent measurement. These precise data allow the geochemical controls on {MORB} redox systematics at both global and local scales to be evaluated. At the global scale, the relationship between log[Fe2O3] and [{MgO}] shows that Fe3+ behaves like a lightly incompatible element ({LICE}) during the crustal evolution of {MORB}, with its incompatibility between those of the redox-insensitive elements Li and In. The variability of Fe3+ about this global trend is also consistent with that of redox-insensitive elements of similar incompatibility, implying no external buffering of oxygen fugacity {fO}2. The variability of Fe3+ is anti-correlated with the variabilities of Sr and Na, which are compatible in plagioclase, but is positively correlated with the variabilities of elements that partition preferentially into clinopyroxene and/or olivine rather than plagioclase, showing that its variability is controlled at least partly by varying ratios of plagioclase to clinopyroxene and olivine during the crustal evolution of {MORB}. Deviations of Fe3+ concentrations from the global trend are, like those of other {LICE}, anticorrelated with the deviations from their global trends of the very incompatible elements ({VICE}). Extrapolation of the global trend to an assumed parental melt at 10.4 wt\% [{MgO}] gives [Fe2O3]o, the concentration of Fe2O3 in the global average {MORB} parental melt, of 0.6 wt\%, which is consistent with 15–20\% partial melting of a spinel lherzolite source with 0.2 to 0.3 wt\% Fe2O3. This estimate of source Fe2O3 agrees with the estimate for fertile upper mantle lherzolite deduced from measurements of Fe3+/∑Fe and total Fe in the minerals of spinel peridotite xenoliths from the lithosphere. The {fO}2 of the {MORB} glasses at 1 bar may be calculated from their measured Fe3+/∑Fe using a new parameterization of 478 experimental data from the literature with {\textless}60 wt\% {SiO}2. The need for the new parameterization arises from recent experimental studies, which, among other aspects, are consistent with the ideal stoichiometry governing the thermodynamic relationship between Fe3+/Fe2+ and {fO}2, namely Fe3+/Fe2+ ∝ ({fO}2)0.25. The parameterization gives: log10⁡(Fe3+/Fe2+)=0.25{ΔQFM}−1.35+0.034[Na2O]+0.044[K2O]+0.023[{CaO}]−0.18[P2O5] where Δ{QFM} is the difference between the {fO}2 of the silicate melt and the quartz–fayalite–magnetite buffer in log10 units, {logfO}2({QFM}) =8.58−25050/T, relative to the conventional standard state of pure O2 at 105 Pa, T is in K, and [Na2O] etc., are the concentrations of the oxide components in weight percent. The global average Δ{QFM} recorded by {MORB} glasses in the compositional range of 5 to 10 wt\% {MgO} is +0.2 ±0.3, with a small but resolvable increase with decreasing {MgO}. There is no evidence that Fe3+/∑Fe systematics in {MORB} are influenced by interactions with other polyvalent elements like S or Cr.},
